* Data set of IMAGENET - 15M to recognize 22k diff objects
* Relationshiip between objects is very imp: Imgaes Dataset - Visual Genome - Data set for relationships between objects
* Video Dataset - Action Genome - 
* Visual intelligence is about looking at image, etc from various angles and not just 1 angle
* Neural Task Programming - Robotical Learning
* Longer Horizon Tasks learning - Curriculum learning - By generating similar target tasks which lead to the final taget task
* SQUAD 
* BEHAVIOR - iGibson2 - environment inspired for robots to learn everyday tasks
