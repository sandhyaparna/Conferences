* Take data centric approach instead of model centric approach
  * Make the labels y consistent: pick a standard, 
  * Use consensus labeling to spot inconsistencies
  * Clarify labeling instructions by tracking down ambiguous examples
  * Toss out noisy example. More data is not always better
  * Use error analysis to focus on subset of data to improve
